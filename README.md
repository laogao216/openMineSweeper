# Game controls: 
Mouse left click on a covered tile to uncover it,

Mouse left click on a uncovered tile to uncover all tiles around it.

Mouse right click on a covered tile to flag it.

Mouse center (or wheel) click on a flag to unflag it.

I understand that the tiles are small, mouses are clumsy, and one mistake would doom a game. So keyboard control is coming
